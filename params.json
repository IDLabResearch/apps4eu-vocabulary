{"name":"Apps4eu-vocabulary","tagline":"Apps4EU vocabulary","body":"# Apps for Europe ontology\r\nThis is a vocabulary to describe Apps for X events. It consists of a vocabulary that describes the diff\u000Berent app concepts, in the same way that DCAT describes datasets. This vocabulary includes properties that describe the datasets used, the applications' formats and access methods, the criteria used for judging the applications, the app contest it was part of, etc. \r\nThe objective is that all the Apps for X contests in Europe use the same vocabulary in order to describe those concepts. \r\n\r\n## Ontologies reused\r\n\r\n* DC\r\nThe Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Metadata Terms vocabulary defines general metadata attributes such as title, creator, date and subject.\r\n\r\n* FOAF\r\nThe Friend Friend (FOAF) vocabulary defines terms for describing people, their activities and their relations to other people and objects\r\n\r\n* Creative Commons\r\nThe Creative Commons (CC) schema defines terms for describing copyright licences.\r\n\r\n* Schema.org\r\nThe Schema.org defines a collection of schemas.\r\n\r\n* Event Ontology\r\nThe Event ontogy deals with the notion of reified events. \r\n\r\n* LODE (Linking Open Descriptions of Events)\r\nThe LODE ontology describes an ontology for publiushing descriptions of historical events as Linked Data and for mapping between other event-related vocabularies and ontologies. \r\n\r\n* DCAT \r\nThe DCAT ontology describes a schema to describe datasets in data catalogs.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
